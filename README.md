 Just Monika is a fan game inspired by Doki Doki Literature Club made by Team Salvato. This project attempts to make Monika a fully developed AI that is able to handle easy conversations with the user.

#### TO-DO-LIST
1. Make a nicer and more informative README.md
2 Create the engine that simulates the behaviour of DDLC 
   - Make the circles from the background circulate correctly
   - Create the visual novel engine
3. Create the AI
4. Make the game resolution-responsive

#### Installation
In the near future I'm going to create a wizard installation but for now you can simply compile the source file and use it on your pc.
