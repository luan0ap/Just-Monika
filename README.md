# Just-Monika
Just Monika is a fan game inspired by Doki Doki Literature Club made by Team Salvato. The project contains spoilers for Doki Doki Literature Club.

TO DO:
     * Finish creating a Menu in Scene 1
     * Get the Assets
     * Change the scene variable into an enum
     * Instead posX of posY try SFML Vectors
     * Use time instead of gameWindow.setFrameLimit(150);

SCENE 1 TO DO LIST:
         * Make multiple circles circulate - only one can circulate atm (and it's doing that extremely slowly)
         * Do the outline for the menu options
         * Get the font for the menu
